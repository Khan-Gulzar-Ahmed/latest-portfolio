    Google’s new Pixel 5a 5G, which replaces the Pixel 4a, is our new pick for the best Android phone. It offers high-quality software and a great camera, for much less than comparable phones.
    
    
    Android phones can vary widely in both price and experience, from just a couple hundred dollars to well over a thousand—and from unbelievably frustrating to unbelievably impressive. We spend hundreds of hours each year testing the latest Android smartphones, and we think the Google Pixel 5a 5G is the best one for most people. It offers outstanding software and camera performance, and it costs much less than high-end models. It will also receive guaranteed software updates for a longer period than most Android phones.

    Our pick
    ￼
    Google Pixel 5a 5G
    
    Best Android smartphone
    
    The Pixel 5a offers the best version of Android, with guaranteed updates through August 2024—plus a fantastic camera, 5G, and a sharp OLED screen, all for hundreds of dollars less than the competition.
    
    $450 from Google
    
    Key specifications:
    
    Screen:6.34-inch OLEDResolution and refresh rate:1080×2400, 60 HzProcessor:Qualcomm Snapdragon 765GMemory and storage:6 GB RAM, 128 GB storageRear cameras:12.2 MP main camera, 16 MP ultrawideMeasurements (HWD):6.1 by 2.9 by 0.3 inches
    
    Google’s Pixel 5a 5G is the latest device in Google’s budget Pixel lineup, but it retains almost all of what you’d expect from a high-end phone. The Pixel 5a has Google’s clean, fast version of Android 11, with three years of guaranteed updates. It also offers camera performance that’s better than what you’d get with phones that cost more than twice as much. However, the Pixel 5a with 5G isn’t quite as fast as the Samsung Galaxy S21 or the OnePlus 9. It also doesn’t support wireless charging or expandable storage, nor does it include a smoother, high-refresh screen. It does, however, have a headphone jack.
    
    If you play a lot of games on your phone and want a more powerful processor, or if you want smoother scrolling and fluid animations, buy the Samsung Galaxy S21 5G. This device has a superb 6.2-inch 1080p OLED display that refreshes 120 times per second (120 Hz), which makes scrolling and navigating apps look impressively smooth. The processor is top of the line, so the S21 works better with heavy multitasking and gaming than the current Pixel phones. Although Samsung’s take on Android can be clunky and confusing compared with Google’s streamlined Pixel version, Samsung does promise four years of updates (one year longer than Google offers). You can expect security updates to show up quickly when available, though major system updates (such as Android 11 to 12) will take a few months longer to be available on Samsung’s phones.
    
    The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G has all the bells and whistles you could ever want in an Android phone. Its stunning 6.
